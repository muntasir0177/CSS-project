            </figure> History of Bangladesh, a survey of the notable events and people in the history of Bangladesh,
            from the
            3rd century bce to the present day. Bangladesh, located in the northeastern region of the Indian
            subcontinent, has been independently ruled since 1971, but the land and peoples of the modern country
            have centuries-long histories that centre on the thriving delta of the Ganges River. Dhaka is the
            capital of Bangladesh, having previously served as the capital city of Bengal province during the Mughal
            dynasty (1608-39 and 1660-1704), East Bengal province (1947), and East Pakistan (1956). <br><br>

            Although Bangladesh has existed as an independent country only since the late 20th century, its national
            character within a broader South Asian context dates to the ancient past. The country's history, then,
            is intertwined with that of India, Pakistan, and other countries of the area. The land of Bangladesh,
            mainly a delta formed by the Padma (Ganges [Ganga]) and Jamuna (Brahmaputra) rivers in the northeastern
            portion of the Indian subcontinent, is protected by forests to the west and a myriad of watercourses in
            the centre. As such, it was long the inaccessible frontier beyond the North Indian Plain and therefore
            was home to a distinctive regional culture. In early times a number of independent principalities
            flourished in the region—called Bengal—including Gangaridai, Vanga, Gauda, Pundra, and Samatata, among
            others. In the 14th century Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was instrumental in unifying many of these
            principalities. The Mughals added more territories, including Bihar and Orissa (now Odisha), both of
            which are now states of India, to constitute Suba Bangalah, which the British colonial administration
            later called the Bengal Presidency. In 1947, when British colonial rule ended, a downsized province of
            Bengal was partitioned into East Bengal and West Bengal. East Bengal was renamed East Pakistan in 1955,
            and in 1971 it became Bangladesh..</p>

                        width="300px" class="allimg" alt=""> The Partition of Bengal in 1947, also known as the Second
                    Partition of Bengal, part of the Partition of
                    India, divided the British Indian Bengal Province along the Radcliffe Line between the Dominion of
                    India
                    and
                    the Dominion of Pakistan. The Bengali Hindu-majority West Bengal became a state of India, and the
                    Bengali
                    Muslim-majority East Bengal (now Bangladesh) became a province of Pakistan. <br><br>

                    On 20 June 1947, the Bengal Legislative Assembly met to decide the future of the Bengal Province, as
                    between
                    being a United Bengal within India or Pakistan or divided into East Bengal and West Bengal as the
                    homelands
                    for the Bengali Muslims and the Bengali Hindus, respectively. At the preliminary joint session, the
                    assembly
                    decided by 126-90 that if it remained united, it should join the new Constituent Assembly of
                    Pakistan.
                    Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58-21 that the province should
                    be
                    partitioned and that West Bengal should join the existing Constituent Assembly of India. In another
                    separate
                    meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106-35 that the province should not be
                    partitioned and by 107-34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of Partition. <br><br>

                    On 6 July 1947, the Sylhet referendum decided to sever Sylhet from Assam and merge it into East
                    Bengal.

                    The partition, with power transferred to Pakistan and India on 14-15 August 1947, was done according
                    to
                    what
                    has come to be known as the 3 June Plan, or the Mountbatten Plan. Indian independence, on 15 August
                    1947,
                    ended over 150 years of British rule and influence in the Indian subcontinent. East Pakistan became
                    the
                    independent country of Bangladesh after the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.</p>

                            K. Fazlul Huq, the Premier of United Bengal who moved the Lahore Resolution and
                            subsequently became the Governor of East Pakistan.</figcaption>
                    </figure> Dhaka was the scene of a meeting of Muslim leaders in late 1906. They created a party for
                    Muslims and
                    declared its loyalty to the British, believing that the British could best protect the interests of
                    Muslims. The late 1800s had seen the introduction of a system of elections based on limited
                    franchise. The franchise was broadened later to increase the number of voters. However, universal
                    franchise never materialized but the Muslim leadership did secure a separate voting system for
                    Muslims
                    in 1909. In the Lucknow Pact of 1916 the Muslim League and Indian National Congress accepted both
                    separate electorates and provincial weightage for minorities. This reduced Bengali Muslim seats to
                    forty
                    percent in a Muslim majority province. The Muslim League regretted this decision. <br><br>

                    Fazlul Huq recreated his government, this time without the Muslim League, in late 1941. Muslim
                    League
                    members led by Khawaja Nazimuddin and Suhrawardy campaigned against Fazlul Huq. Huq resigned in 1943
                    under pressure from the governor. On 24 April 1943 Nazimuddin inaugurated his own ministry at the
                    governor's invitation. Nazimuddin's ministry was seen unfavourably by both the viceroy, Lord Wavell,
                    and
                    the governor.[119] In particular, the Viceroy was disturbed by Nazimuddin's response to the
                    famine.[120]
                    Bengal experienced a great famine during the second world war. Approximately 3 and a half million
                    died,
                    mainly in the countryside of east Bengal. <br><br>

                    In 1946, the British government sent a mission, which ultimately advanced a scheme for a united
                    India.[125] The scheme encapsulated a loose union.[126] A key point for Bengal was the maintenance
                    of
                    its unity under the scheme. The plan was agreed to by Jinnah but Nehru negated it.[125] The Muslim
                    League declared Direct Action Day on 16 August. Rioting followed in Calcutta and many died.[127] The
                    Bhodrolok decided that dividing Bengal would be better than accepting the rule of Muslims. The
                    Muslim
                    League did not want Bengal to be divided, and wanted it fully included in Pakistan. However, the
                    Congress demanded the partition of the province.[124] A few leaders of the Muslim League and
                    Congress
                    started advocating an independent United Bengal. While some politicians like Jinnah and Gandhi
                    supported
                    this idea, the national Congress rejected it in favour of partition. Eastern Bengal was to join
                    Pakistan
                    while Western Bengal would join India.[126] Most of Assam's mainly Muslim Sylhet district opted for
                    Bengal in a plebiscite. The rest joined India with Assam.<br><br>

                    </figure>A rift developed over the question of the national language.[129] The Bengali Language
                    Movement
                    was
                    a political effort in Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan), advocating the recognition of the
                    Bengali language as an official language of Pakistan. Such recognition would allow Bengali to be
                    used in government affairs. It was led by Mufti Nadimul Quamar Ahmed.<br><br>

                    When the state of Pakistan was formed in 1947, its two regions, East Pakistan (also called East
                    Bengal) and West Pakistan, were split along cultural, geographical, and linguistic lines. On 23
                    February 1948, the Government of Pakistan ordained Urdu as the sole national language, sparking
                    extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Pakistan. Facing rising sectarian
                    tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies.
                    The students of the University of Dhaka and other political activists defied the law and organised a
                    protest on 21 February 1952.[131] The movement reached its climax when police opened fire on the
                    students that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest led by the Awami Muslim League, later
                    renamed the Awami League. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted
                    official status to the Bengali language in 1956. On 17 November 1999, UNESCO declared 21 February
                    International Mother Language Day.<br><br>

                    The 1952 events caused the people of East Pakistan to abandon the Muslim League.[133] In
                    East
                    Pakistan's 1954 provincial elections, the League captured only 7 out of the 390 seats.[134] The
                    United
                    Front won the elections. Until 1956, when the state declared that both Bengali and Urdu would be
                    state
                    languages, the language movement continued.<br><br>

                    Great differences began developing between the two wings of Pakistan. While the west had a minority
                    share of Pakistan's total population, it had the largest share of revenue allocation, industrial
                    development, agricultural reforms and civil development projects. Pakistan's military and civil
                    services
                    were dominated by the Punjabis.[136] Bengalis had been designated as a "non-martial" race by the
                    British. Bengali participation in the military was very low. The British preferred to recruit
                    Punjabi
                    Muslims. The Punjabis dominated the army Pakistan inherited from British India's military. Because
                    Bengalis did not have a tradition of military service in their families, it was hard to recruit
                    Bengali
                    officers.<br><br>



                    A West Pakistani movement aimed at removing Ayub Khan spread to East Pakistan where it adopted
                    Bengali
                    nationalist connotations. Ayub Khan resigned in March 1969 and his position was taken by General
                    Yahya
                    Khan. Yahya tried to reconcile the politicians. He announced that elections would be held in 1970
                    and
                    political organisation would be permitted.[140] He declared that his own position was temporary and
                    that
                    his job was to run elections for an assembly who would be tasked with creating a new constitution.
                    He
                    ended the One Unit Scheme and permitted popular representation, thereby allowing East Pakistan 162
                    of
                    the 300 seats. Yahya created a legal framework order (LFO) as a guideline for the assembly. It
                    stipulated principles such as the federalism of the state, paramountcy of Islam, provincial autonomy
                    with sufficient provisions for the federal government to carry out its duties and defend the
                    country's
                    integrity. The latter point clashed with Mujib's points. Yahya highlighted that a constitution would
                    not
                    be accepted if it did not adhere to the LFO. Mujib's party had drafted its own constitution based on
                    six
                    points.<br><br>

                    Pakistan,
                    signed the Instrument of Surrender and the nation of Bangla Desh ("Country of Bengal") was finally
                    established the following day. At the time of surrender only a few countries had provided diplomatic
                    recognition to the new nation. Over 90,000 Pakistani troops surrendered to the Indian forces making
                    it the largest surrender since World War II.[157][158] The new country changed its name to
                    Bangladesh on 11 January 1972 and became a parliamentary democracy under a constitution. Shortly
                    thereafter on 19 March Bangladesh signed a friendship treaty with India. Bangladesh sought admission
                    in the UN with most voting in its favour, but China vetoed this as Pakistan was its key ally.[159]
                    The United States, also a key ally of Pakistan, was one of the last nations to accord Bangladesh
                    recognition.[citation needed] To ensure a smooth transition, in 1972 the Simla Agreement was signed
                    between India and Pakistan. The treaty ensured that Pakistan recognised the independence of
                    Bangladesh in exchange for the return of the Pakistani PoWs. India treated all the PoWs in strict
                    accordance with the Geneva Convention, rule 1925.[160] It released more than 93,000 Pakistani PoWs
                    in five months.<br><br>




                    Besides the Pakistani prisoner of wars there were still collaborators in Bangladesh. In 1973, the
                    Bangladeshi government announced an amnesty for them in exchange for Pakistani recognition. Demands
                    that these be collaborators be tried resurfaced in the 1990s. There was also a large population of
                    non-Bengali Muslims[164] who mostly supported Pakistan. Bengali mobs, who identified them as
                    "Bihari", had killed them before the war and the Biharis had aided the Pakistani army during it.
                    Thousands suffered a counter genocide and at least a million were made homeless.<br><br></p>

                    The Provisional Government of Bangladesh was the country's first government. The Provisional
                    Government was formed in Mujibnagar on 17 April 1971. It issued the proclamation of independence and
                    drafted an interim constitution, declaring "Equality, Human Dignity and Social Justice" as its
                    fundamental principles. Its prime minister was Tajuddin Ahmad and military chief of staff was M A G
                    Osmani. Other important cabinet members included Syed Nazrul Islam and Muhammad Mansur Ali. It
                    included the newly formed Bangladesh Civil Service with defecting members of the Civil Service of
                    Pakistan. It also had a prominent diplomatic corps, led by Abu Sayeed Chowdhury, Humayun Rashid
                    Choudhury and Rehman Sobhan among others. The Bangladesh Forces included eleven sector commanders,
                    among whom prominent figures included Ziaur Rahman, Khaled Mosharraf and K M Shafiullah.<br><br>

                    Neighboring India provided diplomatic, economic and military support for the Provisional Government.
                    The government's capital in exile was Calcutta. The Indian military intervened in the final two
                    weeks of the war in December 1971, ensuring the surrender of Pakistan.<br><br>

                    <h3>The fall of Hasina administration</h3>
                    <p>In June 2024, protests began in response to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh reinstating a 30%
                        quota
                        for government jobs for descendants of freedom fighters, reversing the government decision made
                        in
                        response to the 2018 Bangladesh quota reform movement. Students began to feel like they have a
                        limited opportunity based on merit. The protest, which initially began as a response to the
                        reestablished quota system for government jobs, quickly spread throughout the entire country
                        because
                        of the government's violent response, as well as growing public dissatisfaction against an
                        oppressive government. The situation was further complicated by many other ongoing issues, like
                        the
                        government's inability to manage a prolonged economic downturn, reports of rampant corruption
                        and
                        human rights violations, and the absence of democratic channels for initiating
                        changes.<br><br>

                        width="300px" class="allimg" alt=""> On 3 August 2024, coordinators of the Anti-discrimination
                    Students Movement announced a
                    one-point
                    demand for the resignation and called for "comprehensive non-cooperation". The following
                    day, violent clashes broke out, resulting in the deaths of 97 people, including students. The
                    coordinators called for a long march to Dhaka to force Hasina out of power on 5 August. That day, a
                    large crowd of protesters made its way through the capital.[225] At 2:30 p.m. BST, Sheikh Hasina
                    resigned and fled to India.<br><br>

                    On 5 August, the chief of army staff, Waker-uz-Zaman, convened a meeting with representatives from
                    the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jatiya Party (Ershad), and Jamaat-e-Islami[227] and called
                    for the creation of an interim government within 48 hours, excluding the Awami League.[228]
                    Subsequent reports indicated that Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate, had been approached to be the
                    head of the interim government.[229] The nomination of Yunus, who accepted the advisory role in the
                    interim government, has also been supported by prominent figures within the student movement.[230]
                    In addition, Waker-uz-Zaman pledged an investigation by the military into the preceding incidents of
                    violence and issued an order prohibiting security forces from opening fire on crowds.<br><br></p>
